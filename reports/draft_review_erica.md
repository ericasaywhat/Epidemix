# Review of Nick Steelman and Matt Brucker's "Effects of Defectors on Greedy Routing in Complex Networks"

###### Erica Lee

#### What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

I was a little confused when reading the abstract what the Kleineberg experiment was. The word “game” is suddenly introduced without much context, but this is all cleared up in the next section. There is a bit of a road map in the abstract that I’m not sure is necessary, where you state each step you took in replicating the Kleineberg game. Overall, however, the paper as a whole is clear in explaining the experiment and results and addresses the question of how changing nodes’ decision to defect affects complex networks such as the internet with greedy routing.

#### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I understand the methodology used for this paper. The paper explains all the variables except k. The methodology becomes clear later in the paper. How random is “random”?

#### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

Some of the figure captions are weirdly formatted, but the figures are very effective in communicating the results clearly. Figure 3 is a little bit cut off on the left. All figures have labels and captions and are clearly explained. For Figure 4, it might be helpful to have a colour bar similar to the ones in Figure 3 for visualization of the meaning behind the variations in colour even though it is explained in the following paragraph.

#### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The draft report uses the results to ascertain that the model proposed is in fact accurate to the original experiment. In that regard, the argument seems to hold up rather well despite the lack of resolution in the generated graphs compared to the original.

#### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how
The results are qualitatively consistent with that of the original paper (the more payoff, the less dropped messages).

#### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

The motivation behind having your nodes choose randomly whether to defect or not isn’t clear until much later in the paper. (Also, how random is “random”?) The results of your algorithm are similar to that of the experiment replicated. This extension provides a qualitatively more realistic model to the Kleineberg original, though noisier and less defined.

#### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

You are pretty good on progress. It seems like the paper is pretty much done and only in need of polishing up. Graphs that are less noisy and more defined would be a bonus, but maybe a bit of an unrealistic goal for lack of computation power.

#### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

There is a slight mix-up in tenses that violates #3 in Allen’s Style Guide that urges you to use the present tense. I think there is also a sentence near the end that uses the passive voice. Overall, it’s pretty clear in language, though it can be more concise.

#### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?

The title doesn’t really convey the “more accurate” part of the paper compared to Kleineberg, but is pretty explanatory of the paper. The figure and figure captions of at least one figure is pushed all the way to the right. Some figures are centered and others are left justified and the spacing seems a little weird. Because the bibliography is annotated, it might be helpful to have each source numbered to distinguish between the annotations and the actual citations. The last citation doesn’t seem to belong.
